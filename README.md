## Prerequisites

- Ghost Content API key

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
GHOST_URL=https://your-ghost-blog.com
GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY=your_content_api_key
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummus-erectus/ghost-nextjs-blog.git
cd ghost-nextjs-blog
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your blog.

## Configuration

### Image Domains

The `next.config.ts` file contains configuration for external image domains. If your Ghost instance uses custom image domains or you want to display images from other sources (like Unsplash), add them to the `remotePatterns` array:

```typescript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: "https",
      hostname: "your-ghost-blog.com",
      pathname: "/content/images/**",
    },
    {
      protocol: "https",
      hostname: "images.unsplash.com",
      pathname: "/**",
    },
  ],
}
```

### Ghost API Settings

The Ghost API configuration is located in `src/lib/post.ts`. You can modify this file to customize the fields fetched from Ghost or change the API behavior.

## Customization

### Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the design by:

- Modifying `tailwind.config.ts` for theme configuration
- Updating `src/app/globals.css` for global styles
- Editing `src/app/ghost-content.css` for Ghost-specific component styling

### Components

The main blog components are located in:

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage/blog listing
- `src/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual blog post pages

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (recommended)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
